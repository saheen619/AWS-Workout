# **Incremental Data Pipeline**

An incremental data pipeline is a type of data pipeline that only processes new or changed data since the last run. This is in contrast to a full data pipeline, which processes all of the data in the source every time the pipeline runs.

Incremental data pipelines are more efficient than full data pipelines because they only process the data that has changed. This can save a lot of time and resources, especially if the source data is large.

There are a number of different ways to implement incremental data pipelines. One common approach is to use a change data capture (CDC) tool. CDC tools track changes to the source data and then report those changes to the data pipeline. The data pipeline can then use this information to process only the changed data.

Another approach to implementing incremental data pipelines is to use a timestamp. The data pipeline can be configured to only process data that has been modified since a certain timestamp.

Incremental data pipelines can be a valuable tool for organizations that need to process large amounts of data on a regular basis. They can help to save time and resources, and they can also help to improve the performance of the data pipeline.

## **Here are some of the advantages of using incremental data pipelines**:

**Efficiency**: Incremental data pipelines are more efficient than full data pipelines because they only process the data that has changed. This can save a lot of time and resources, especially if the source data is large.   

**Performance**: Incremental data pipelines can improve the performance of the data pipeline by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed. This can lead to faster load times and better performance for queries.

**Scalability**: Incremental data pipelines are scalable, meaning that they can be easily scaled up or down to meet the needs of the organization. This is important for organizations that need to process large amounts of data or that need to be able to handle spikes in demand.


## **Here are some of the disadvantages of using incremental data pipelines**:

**Complexity**: Incremental data pipelines can be more complex to implement than full data pipelines. This is because they require the use of change data capture (CDC) tools or timestamps.

**Data loss**: If the source data is not properly synchronized, there is a risk of data loss. This is because the data pipeline will only process the data that has changed since the last run. If any data is lost between runs, it will not be processed by the data pipeline.

**Security**: Incremental data pipelines can be more vulnerable to security breaches than full data pipelines. This is because they require access to the source data. If this access is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized access to the data.

Overall, incremental data pipelines can be a valuable tool for organizations that need to process large amounts of data on a regular basis. However, it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages before deciding whether or not to use them.

# In AWS Glue:

Incremental data load can be possible in an AWS Glue Job by enabling 'JOB BOOKMARK' which comes under job-details.
